>>>GENRAL TAB WORKING:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Genral tab is designed to sort the diffrent file AUTOMATICALLY on the basis of thier extensions.
Just select the source directory to be sorted and click on  START

Once the process is started , the software will automatically creates FOLDERS for the types of files found.
For example: If software found Image files in the selected drectory then it will automatically create a folder for
images with name 'Fetch-x Images' and all the image files found later will be added to this folder.

In the end as an OUTPUT you will see the directory with sorted files into well maintained and named folders.
